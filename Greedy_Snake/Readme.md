# Greedy Snake Game

Greedy Snake is a classical game since I was a child. That time mobile phones'  srcreen had only two colors. It provided me a lot fun though the game looked simple. Today I wrote my own version with Qt and C++.It can be downloaded and build on platforms with Windows, macos or Linux Systems as long as you have Qt5. The zip file is the game and should be able to run directly on Winows 10.

## Game's General Describtion
Click the executable file or build it on your own Qt Creator. A launch splash image will be presented for  *10*s.

## How to build it?
## Problems
There are still some problems remain. 
1. No launch splash screen. Because absolute path is used to load the splash image in `main.cpp`.
