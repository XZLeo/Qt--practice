# Qt--practice
These are basiclly all my practice projects of Qt Widget. My platform are Qt 5.12 and Qt Creator 4.8.0. 
At present only C++ programs for QWidget are included, but maybe I will spent time on QML programming and develop Android applications later.
These pojects are:
1. SplashScreen: Display a boot screen;
2. Clock: a LCD style clock desktop application;
3. KeyEvent: use directon keys to control the movement of an icon;
4. DialogExample: show various kinds of dialog;
5. Palette: use QPalette class to adjust different parts' color of a window; 
6. Greedy Snake: a classical game on computer, use direction key on the keyboard to control sanke's drection. 

Greedy Snake is what I focused on recently which requires the knowledge of various class of Qt and  aslo a clear mind to design the program. It can be downloaded and build on  platforms with Windows, macos or Linux Systems as long as you have Qt5. The zip file is the game and should be able to run directly on Windows.
