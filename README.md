# Qt--practice
These are basiclly all my practice projects of Qt Widget. My platform are Qt 5.12 and Qt Creator 4.8.0. 
At present only C++ programs for QWidget are included, but maybe I will spent time on QML programming and develop Android applications later.
These pojects are:
1. SplashScreen: Display a boot screen;
2. Clock: a LCD style clock desktop application;
3. KeyEvent: use directon keys to control the movement of an icon;
4. DialogExample: show various kinds of dialog;
5. Palette: use QPalette class to adjust different parts' color of a window;
